# Red Hook Ferry Checker Alexa Skill

This enhanced Alexa skill provides comprehensive information about ferry departures from the Red Hook terminal in Brooklyn, NY, with real-time data, service alerts, and improved user experience.

## üöÄ New Features

### Enhanced Functionality
- **Dynamic GTFS data loading** - Automatically discovers routes and stops from NYC Ferry's static GTFS feed
- **Real-time service alerts** - Get notified about delays and disruptions
- **Interactive service alerts** - Say "yes" when prompted to hear current alerts
- **Time-specific queries** - Ask for ferries after a specific time
- **Improved error handling** - Better fallback responses and error recovery
- **Timezone awareness** - Proper Eastern Time handling
- **Service hours validation** - Knows when ferries aren't running
- **Delay information** - Shows if ferries are running late

### Better User Experience
- **Interactive prompts** - Skill asks if you'd like to hear service alerts and responds properly to yes/no
- **More natural responses** - Includes destination information and relative timing
- **Comprehensive help** - Better guidance on what you can ask
- **Structured logging** - Better debugging and monitoring
- **Fallback data** - Provides estimated times when real-time data is unavailable
- **Automatic route discovery** - No more hardcoded route information

### Recent Bug Fixes ‚úÖ
- **Fixed "yes" response bug** - Now correctly shows service alerts instead of repeating ferry schedule
- **Fixed session management** - Proper handling of alertsOffered and alertsMentioned flags
- **Fixed service alert filtering** - Correctly filters alerts for Red Hook route using informedEntity
- **Fixed intent handler separation** - YesIntent and GetNextDayFerriesIntent now properly separated

## üó£Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Basic Queries
- "Alexa, open Red Hook Ferry"
- "Alexa, ask Red Hook Ferry when is the next ferry"
- "Alexa, ask Red Hook Ferry for the ferry schedule"

### Time-Specific Queries
- "Alexa, ask Red Hook Ferry for ferries after 3 PM"
- "Alexa, ask Red Hook Ferry when do ferries leave after 2:30"
- "Alexa, ask Red Hook Ferry for departures after 5 o'clock"

### Service Information
- "Alexa, ask Red Hook Ferry are there any service alerts"
- "Alexa, ask Red Hook Ferry check for delays"
- "Alexa, ask Red Hook Ferry about service disruptions"

### Interactive Features
After asking for ferry times, the skill will prompt:
- **"Would you like to hear about current service alerts for this route?"**
- Respond with **"Yes"** to hear service alerts
- Respond with **"No"** to end the conversation
- This interactive feature was recently fixed to work properly!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

**GTFSStaticService** (`gtfsStaticService.js`)
- Downloads and parses NYC Ferry's static GTFS feed
- Discovers stops, routes, and trip sequences dynamically
- Provides caching with automatic refresh
- Handles ZIP file extraction and CSV parsing

**FerryService** (`ferryService.js`)
- Handles all GTFS real-time data fetching and parsing
- Manages service alerts and real-time updates
- Integrates with static GTFS data for enhanced responses
- Provides fallback data when APIs are unavailable

**Utils** (`utils.js`)
- Time parsing and formatting utilities
- Input validation and sanitization
- Logging and debugging helpers

**Configuration** (`config.js`)
- Centralized configuration management
- Environment variable handling
- Fallback route and service hour definitions

### Data Flow
1. User makes voice request to Alexa
2. Ferry service initializes with static GTFS data (cached for 24 hours)
3. Intent handler processes the request
4. FerryService fetches real-time GTFS data
5. Static and real-time data are combined for accurate responses
6. Response is formatted for natural speech output
7. Alexa speaks the response to the user

- `*.zip` - Deployment packages that may contain sensitive configuration
- `localTest.js` - Local testing scripts that may contain test data

### Setup for Development
1. Copy template files: `cp skill.json.template skill.json` and `cp .env.example .env`
